    <div class="abtme-p"
        <p>I'm a super curious engineering student that thoroughly enjoys learning about things 
        that don't initially make sense. I enjoy solving problems that make me think and challenge 
        me to come up with creative solutions. Combining these two passions has lead me to take up 
        interest in both mechanical and computer engineering. I've found that I'm most interested 
        in computer design and electromechanical systems, and I'm aiming to learn effective design 
        methodologies that can enhance my individual capabilities and teamwork dynamic.</p>
